# Hadoop with Google Cloud Dataproc

* Bertolt Sobolik (hid-sp18-419)

## Introduction

Google offers two managed cloud services for running Hadoop and Spark: Cloud Dataproc and Cloud Dataflow. 

## Prerequisites

In order to create a VM on Google Compute Engine one must have a
Google Account. You can sign up for one
[here](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en).

Next, you will need to [sign up for Google Cloud
Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial). As of this
writing, Google is offering a free trial that includes $300 worth of
credits that expire one year from signup, but you will need to provide
billing information (either a credit card or bank details) to sign
up~\cite{hid-sp18-419-tutorial-gce-signup}.
