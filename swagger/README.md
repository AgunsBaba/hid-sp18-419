# REST Service with Swagger
## Google Compute Engine: VM Instance

[Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances)

As of 2/11/2018 partial specification of GCP instance API has been
written. Code generated with swaggger-codegen.

Next:

- Implement a few functions to make sure I am on the right track
  before spending a lot of time writing a flawed API specification.
- Set up a few instances for testing and figure out authentication
