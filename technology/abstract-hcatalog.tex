{\bf the extensive number of backslash index refernces is confusing as the main
  text is not about microsoft for example. Improve in all you rentries
and select the once you realy need to index. just put the index bellow
the section so the text stays readable in the source.}

HCatalog, which was originally known as Howl, is a component shipped
with Hive that manages storage and tables. Its purpose is to simplify
data storage and retrieval by providing a shared schema and data type
mechanism between Hive, Pig\index{Pig}, and MapReduce and the formats
in which a Hadoop serializer-deserializer can be written (ORC,
RCFile, CSV, JSON, and SequenceFile.) Custom formats can be added as
well. A REST API called WebHCat (originally Templeton) is also
available~\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-hc-wiki}.
