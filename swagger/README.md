# REST Service with Swagger
## Google Compute Engine: VM Instance

[Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances)

Code generated with swagger-codegen using google_compute_engine_basic.yml.

### Authentication
`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`

`pip install --upgrade google-auth-httplib2`

Sample code is [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/master/compute/api)

Next:

- Implement a few functions to make sure I am on the right track
  before spending a lot of time writing a flawed API specification.
- Set up a few instances for testing and figure out authentication
