\begin{abstract}
\TODO{Add model of Raspberry Pi (3B?)}
\TODO{Add data set used}
Spark and Hadoop clusters were created on ten networked Raspberry
Pis. The aim was to create the cluster in a repeatable and scalable
fashion, automating as much of the setup process as possible. Spark
and Hadoop were deployed and configured to run as Docker containers
and directly on the operating system. Configurations were tested to
compare Hadoop against Spark, and Docker against direct
installation. Hadoop and Spark were also configured in Docker and
natively on Futuresystems Echo and similar performance tests were done
to compare the performance of the configuration on Echo against that
of the Pis.

\section{Deployment}
To configure the Raspberry Pis, first SD cards were burned using a
script that take start and end machine id numbers as an input. The
option to perform DHCP setup can be enabled with a flag. If DHCP is
not used, the script assigns static IPs to each machine.
