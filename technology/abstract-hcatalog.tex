HCatalog, which was originally known as Howl, is a component shipped
with Hive \index{Hive} that manages storage and tables. Its purpose is
to simplify data storage and retrieval by providing a shared schema
and data type mechanism between Hive, Pig \index{Pig}, and MapReduce
\index{MapReduce} and the formats in which a Hadoop \index{Hadoop}
serializer-deserializer can be written (ORC \index{ORC}, RCFile
\index{RCFile}, CSV \index{CSV}, JSON \index{JSON}, and SequenceFile
\index{SequenceFile}.) Custom formats can be added as well. A REST
\index{REST} API called WebHCat \index{WebHCat} (originally Templeton)
is also available \cite{hid-sp18-419-www-hc-wiki}.
