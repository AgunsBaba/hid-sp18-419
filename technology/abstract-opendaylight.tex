{\bf the extensive number of backslash index refernces is confusing as the main
  text is not about microsoft for example. Improve in all you rentries
and select the once you realy need to index. just put the index bellow
the section so the text stays readable in the source.}

OpenDaylight is an open source Software Defined Networks (SDN)
controller\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-opendaylight}. SDN separates network
control logic from physical networking equipment. The result is that
networking equipment is programmable like other computing
platforms. SDN facilitates Network Functions Virtualization(NFV),
allowing virtual network services (switching, virtualized
appliances, and virtualized applications) to be deployed without
having to deploy specialized physical
devices\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-cio-sdn-nfv}. The OpenDaylight project
was founded by a group of large tech companies, including Cisco,
Citrix, Ericsson, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, Red Hat, and
VMware. Microsoft and VMware have since left the
project\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-sdx-odl}.
