{\bf the extensive number of backslash index refernces is confusing as the main
  text is not about microsoft for example. Improve in all you rentries
and select the once you realy need to index. just put the index bellow
the section so the text stays readable in the source.}


Clive is an open-source operating system written in Go\index{Go} by
the Laboratorio De Sistemas at Universidad Rey Juan
Carlos\index{Universidad Rey Juan Carlos} in
Madrid\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub}. The design goal is to create
an environment where applications and services can be compiled along
with libraries that permit them to run on bare hardware without a
software stack\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-clive-lsub2014}. The design is
based on Plan 9\index{Plan 9}, a research system developed at Bell
Labs\index{Bell Labs} in the late 1980s and first released in
1992\cite{hid-sp18-419-www-about-plan9}.
